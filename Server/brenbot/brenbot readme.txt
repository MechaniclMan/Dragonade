BRenBot works with Dragonade by default. Just be sure to set the port number in both da.ini and ssgm.ini.

You should disable Minimum_Scripts_Version, Gamelog_Show_Vehicle_Stolen, Enable_CMSG_Paging, and the donate command and use DA's versions 
of these functions instead.

A plugin is provided to relay DA's log messages to IRC. When using this plugin you should disable the following settings in BRenBot as the plugin 
replaces them: Gamelog_Show_Vehicle_Purchase, Gamelog_Show_Kill_Messages, Gamelog_Show_Vehicle_Kill_Messages, and Gamelog_Show_Building_Kill_Messages.
