/*
The following are examples on how to use some of the core sytems in DA:

Event System
Game Mode System
Game Feature System
Player Observers
Player Data Manager
Improved GameObject Observers
Game Mode Framework

These systems are designed to allow features to be decentralized. No longer do you have to manually initialize everything from one place,
nor do you need a central settings struct that holds all settings. Instead game features and game modes are registered using a registrant
and automatically loaded when enabled, and automatically unloaded when disabled.

Note that DA has no plugin interface. Instead you just use the Event, Game Mode, and Game Feature Systems to implement things 
in the exact same way DA does.
*/


/*
DA's core is divided into various manager classes. Each one handling a different type of object or aspect of the game. 
Generally, managers implement the following types of things:
-Essential functionality that is used to implement other features.
-Non-essential functionality that is centralized so there aren't multiple implementions of it in various game features.
-Settings too small, or that would not be appropriate, to make a game feature out of.
-Log messages.
-Default events.
-Console commands.

/*
At the heart of DA is the Event System. The DAEventClass includes over 60 different events divided into a few different types.
Core classes, managers, game features, and game modes all make use of this class to implement their functionality.

Event Type:
1. DAEvent. These are events that can happen either to players, or the game in general. They are registered with Register_Event.
2. DAObjectEvent. These can involve multiple types of objects. The second parameter determines what type of objects will trigger the event.
   Registered with Register_Object_Event.

Event Format:
1. Returns bool/int. These allow you to block or somehow affect the event. If suffixed with "Request" then it will be paired with a similarly named
event that triggers after the event is completed. Examples of this would be the chat, purchase, and damage events.
2. Void. These trigger after the event is complete and cannot be blocked or modified. Examples of this are the player leave and level loaded events.

DAEventClasses have timer functionality and can have chat commands or key hooks directly bound to them. See below for examples of this.
See da_event.h for the full list of events.
*/


/*
Each game mode has its own settings file in which all settings can be defined. This allows you to enable infinite ammo for only the Domination game mode, for exmaple.

/*
GameObjObserverClass is the base of ScriptImpClass. It provides the various events, such as Custom and Destroyed, while the ScriptImpClass provides
the script parameters and means to create the observer. Scripts were never really intended for what we've used them for, tough. They were intended
to be attached to objects in leveledit, not by other scripts or code. This makes them somewhat hard to work with if you need to create them directly
or pass complex parameters. For this reason scripts are no longer used anywhere in DA. In most cases a DAEventClass is used to implement a feature
that would have previously been implemented through a script attached to every object.

However, there are still a few places where script functionality is useful, such as crate effects or the vehicle ownership system. 
For this we have DAGameObjObserverClass.
It's an improved version of GameObjObserverClass that can be attached to an object similarly to ScriptImpClass. 
It includes extra events, better timer functionality, and an easier method of attaching to objects.

The following is used to attach a DAGameObjObserverClass:

obj->Add_Observer(new DAGameObjObserverClass);

See da_gameobj.h for the full list of events.
